    <ol>
        <li>Five Feet Apart</li>
        <p>It was a sad story. It taught me to make the best the best use of my time and appreciate my loved ones because life can be cut short in the blink of an eye.</p>
    
        <li>The Hate U Give</li>
        <p>A rollercoaster of emotions. It was really an eye opener to the brutality faced by Blacks.</p>

        <li>Crazy Rich Asians</li>
        <p>As a sucker for rom-coms, this movie definitely had my heart. Crazy Rich Asians was everything and more. The wedding scene? Perfection! </p>

        <li>Divergent</li>
        <p>Wasn't expecting a sci-fi movie when i came across it but it turned out to be nice. The lead characters were the highlight of the movie for me.</p>

        <li>Moana</li>
        <p>Of course, there has to be an animation in the list. Don't blame me the songs are catchy. It was a good movie. Who else can't wait for the second installment coming soon?
            I know i'm not alone. Watch it and thank me later. You're welcome!
